## Background

`surfgeopy` rests on curved surface triangulations realised due to $k^{\text{th}}$-order interpolation of the closest point projection, extending initial linear surface approximations. It achieves this by employing a novel technique called square-squeezing, which involves transforming the interpolation tasks of triangulated manifolds to the standard hypercube using a cube-to-simplex transformation that has been recently introduced.
To ensure the stability and accuracy of the computations, surfgeopy leverages classic Chebyshev-Lobatto grids. These grids enable the calculation of high-order interpolants for the surface geometry while avoiding Runge's phenomenon, a common issue in numerical analysis.



## Surface approximation using polynomial interpolation!

<img src="images/approximation_frame.jpg" alt="drawing" width="4000"/>

Consider an element $T_{i}$ in a reference surface $T$. We consider the affine transformation and closest point projection:

- $\tau_i : \Delta_2 \rightarrow T_i$
- $\pi_i : T_i \rightarrow S_i$

Setting

- $\varphi_i : \square_2 \rightarrow S_i, \quad \varphi_i = \pi_i \circ \tau_i\circ \sigma$
where $\sigma$ is a mapping from the reference square $\square_2$ to the the reference triangle $\Delta_2$.

- We compute  $Q_{G_{2,k}} \varphi_i$ be the vector-valued tensor-polynomial interpolant of $\varphi_i$ in the Chebyshev--Lobbatto grid

- $Q_{G_{2,k}} \varphi_i = \sum_{\alpha \in A_{2,k}} \varphi_i(p_\alpha)L_{\alpha} = \sum_{\alpha \in A_{2,k}}b_\alpha N_{\alpha}$
  where the coefficients $b_\alpha \in \R$ of the Newton interpolation can be computed in closed form.

Substituting the surface geometry $\varphi_i$ with Chebyshev‚ÄìLobatto interpolants $Q_{G_{2,k}} \varphi_i$, yields a closed-form expression for the integral. This expression can be accurately computed using high-order quadrature rules.

 $\int_S fdS \approx\sum_{i=1}^K \int_{\square_2} (f\circ\varphi_i)(\mathrm{x}) \sqrt{\det((DQ_{G_{2,k}}\varphi_i(\mathrm{x}))^T DQ_{G_{2,k}}\varphi_i(\mathrm{x}))} d\mathrm{x}\approx \sum_{i=1}^K \sum_{\mathrm{p} \in P}\omega_{\mathrm{p}} (f \circ\varphi_i)(\mathrm{p})\sqrt{\det((DQ_{G_{2,k}}\varphi_i(\mathrm{p}))^T DQ_{G_{2,k}}\varphi_i(\mathrm{p}))}.$

## Refinement  

As a refinement procedure, we use the so called triangular quadrisection when the initial triangle is replaced with four triangles until a certain tol is reached. Triangular quadrisection is a linear subdivision procedure which inserts new vertices at the edge midpoints of the input mesh,  thereby producing four new faces for every face of the original mesh:
 
                      x3                        x3
                     /  \      subdivision     /  \
                    /    \        ====>       v3__v2
                   /      \                  / \  / \
                 x1________x2              x1___v1___x2
 
                       Original vertices : x1, x2, x3
 
                       New vertices      : v1, v2, v3
 
                       New faces         : [x1 v1 v3; x2 v2 v1; x3 v3 v2; v1 v2 v3] 
                      






## üéâ Roadmap

 We are currently working on:

- Incorporating distmesh for generating mesh in python 
- Extending HOSQ  for a wide range of non-parametrized surfaces 

More Coming soon...

### üõ†Ô∏è Install

Since this implementation is a prototype, we currently only provide the installation by self-building from source. We recommend to using `git` to get the `surfgeopy` source:

```bash
git clone https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/interpol/surfgeopy.git
```

> üöß Switch to the `conda` or `venv` virtual environment of your choice where you would like to install the library.

From within the environment, install using [pip],

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The `-e` argument specifies to install softlinks so that any changes made by the user to the source in the source folders are reflected in the install when importing modules.

> You **must not** use the command `python setup.py install` to install `surfgeopy`,
as you cannot always assume the files `setup.py` will always be present
in the further development of `surfgeopy`.

- If you would like to use `surfgeopy` in MATLAB, please refer to [this link](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/interpol/surfgeopy/-/blob/dev/README_MATLAB.md?ref_type=heads).
- Documentation: https://surfgeopy.readthedocs.io

## Testing

After installation, we encourage you to at least run the unit tests of `surfgeopy`,
where we use [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) to run the tests.

If you want to run all tests, type:

```bash
pytest [-vvv]
```
